// We can place the <Menu> component either in App.js or in Layout.js, either ways App renders the whole application and Layout will wrap all the pages components. we prefer to place it though in the Layout component since the Menue shall be shown in all cases, and since it really belongs to the layout of the landing page, so we put it in the Layout.ss
